### File

* Hangman game

### Instructions

* Open the file in Chrome to start. 
Press Enter key to begin (The game actually starts without the enter key. It starts the audio. You can press any letter to begin). 

*Only letters (and Enter when prompted) are valid key presses in the game.
 
Each wrong guess will reduce the guesses left and show in the Guessed already field. After 10 wrong guesses, the game will end. MR FREEZE meme will show up

If you guess correctly, the corresponding song to the guessed answer will play the next round.

RUN CONSOLE TO SEE ANSWER AND HELP YOU GUESS CORRECTLY AND/OR INCORRECTLY INSTEAD OF RANDOM KEY PRESSES.

****
Important: Make sure caps lock key is not on. It will only take lowercase enteries. 

When you lose, it says to refresh the game to play again. I could have run functions to intialize the game again, but it was working well enough and it was 2am so I did a code freeze while I was ahead. I would consider this earlier in the next project
